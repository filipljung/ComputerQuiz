## Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game (one of them being played by computer or human). In this game, there is a board with 3 x 3 squares.

The two players take turns putting marks on a 3x3 board. The goal of Tic Tac Toe game is to be one of the players to get three same symbols in a row - horizontally, vertically or diagonally on a 3 x 3 grid. The player who first gets 3 of his/her symbols (marks) in a row - vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game, and the other loses the game. The game can be played by two players. There are two options for players: (a) Human (b) Computer

GAME RULES:
A player can choose between two symbols with his opponent, usual game uses “X” and “O”.

The player that gets to play first will get the "X" mark (we call him/her player 1) and the player that gets to play second will get the "O" mark (we call him/her player 2).

Player 1 and 2 take turns making moves with Player 1 playing mark “X” and Player 2 playing mark “O”.

A player marks any of the 3x3 squares with his mark (“X” or “O”) and their aim is to create a straight line horizontally, vertically or diagonally with two intensions:
a. One of the players gets three of his/her marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) i.e. that player wins the game.
b. If no one can create a straight line with their own mark and all the positions on the board are occupied, then the game ends in a

## Implementation Plan:

Picture in map



## General Information
- Learn to play a python TicTacToe
- The purpose of is to learn to create a game, and make it as functional as possible 



## Usage
How does one go about using it?
log in to the live site and wait for it to start and start answer the questions and get your final result



## Project Status
Project is: still inn progress do get updated and make it more realistic.


## Room for Improvement
Include areas you believe need improvement / could be improved. Also add TODOs for future development.

Room for improvement:
- make it nice with a board behind it 
- make a leaderboard so that you can see peoples wins 

To do:
- more friendly and just with a click to put X or O on the Board
- maybe little more animated with the Cirle and X, and the board itself
